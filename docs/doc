    mininette [OPTION]... DIRECTORY... EXERCISE NAME...

DESCRIPTION
    This tool will copy all your current work from a given path into the current directory in a folder named 'output'.
    It will also launch standard test (norminette), compile and finally launch a diff test (mininette).
    Using 'output' directory for working is at your own risk, it will be remove/clean each launch of the mininette.
    Three types of test is available using its own file:
        -   function    main.c
        -   program     prog-cmd-[0-99].txt
        -   makefile    make-cmd-[0-99].txt
    Each file must be placed in a valide path (see 'Directory tree' for more information), if the file is missing the test is count as 'unavailable'.
    For the program test or the makefile test, if extra files is needed, they must be placed in the 'test_file' directory.
    After all tests, you have at your disposal in the 'output' directory:
        -   trace.txt   text file with the traces of diff tests
        -   src.txt     text file with all the source code
        -   objects     all executable objects
    And a log file named 'mini.log' in the current directory.
